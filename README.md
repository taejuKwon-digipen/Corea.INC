## Field Part
On this stage, the player's goal is to help the hero out of sight.

If you press the upper right button, you can generate an npc so that the hero does not get bored. NPC must be in the hero's sight to get points.

You can create an item by pressing the bottom right button. If Hero floats "!" this means Hero notices that one of his stats is particularly low. Then, the player must create an item corresponding to it and drag it outside the field of view so that the player does not notice it.

You can repair items by pressing the bottom left button. Since it is a game company that manages games, other heroes can appear at any time other than the current heroes. In that sense, if the item used breaks down, it should be fixed in advance.

The currently implemented part is simply pressing the button to create an item, and raising the score by one point if the npc comes into view. It will be updated later.

## Item Part
On this stage, you have to pick the right element for making potion.

You can see the hero's current stat and have to choose the right materials which is needed to hero. You can open the guide book whenever by pressing the guidebook. If you don't want to see it, you can close it by pressing guide book button. When you finish to choosing, you can go to main game screen by pressing the pot if the answer is right.

The answer is red and dark green potion. (0, 2)
